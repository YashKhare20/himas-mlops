# HIMAS Federated Learning - Quick Start

Privacy-preserving medical ML where hospitals collaborate without sharing patient data.

## What You Need

**Docker Method:**
- Docker & Docker Compose

**Local Method:**
- Python 3.8+
- `pip install flwr==1.11.0 scikit-learn numpy pandas`

## Run It

### Docker (Real Distributed System)

docker-compose up --build

### Local Testing

python main_himas_federated.py

### What Happens 
1. Dataset split into 3 parts (one per hospital)
2. Each hospital trains locally on their data
3. Only model weights shared with server (31 numbers)
4. Server averages weights â†’ global model
5. Repeat for 3 rounds

### Key Files

docker-compose.yml - Runs 4 containers
docker_client.py - Hospital client code
flower_server.py - Central coordinator

#### Privacy
ðŸ”’ Patient data never leaves the hospital - only 31 model weights are shared.
